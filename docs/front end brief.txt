Front-End Brief

Project Overview
This project delivers a multi-platform front-end system composed of a Web Dashboard (Admin/Manager interface) and a Mobile Application, both integrated with a unified backend API.
The solution is part of a larger system that manages materials, recipes, products, machines, orders, advertising, and telemetry data for automated chemical machines.
The goal is to provide a seamless, secure, and responsive interface for both administrative operations (via the dashboard) and user interaction with their assigned machines (via the mobile app).
Objectives
-	Provide ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) to manage recipes, products, machines, and advertising content.
-	Maintain real-time visibility into machine states, orders, and executions via dashboards and live updates.
-	Support efficient CRUD operations for recipes, groups, materials, and related entities with strong data validation and auditability.
-	Deliver a consistent UX/UI across desktop and mobile with localization (English/Arabic) and accessibility compliance.
-	Dashboard and Application
